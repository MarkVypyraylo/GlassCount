GlassCount
=========

GlassCount is an app for Google Glass that allows you to count how many Glass Explorers you see at Google IO.  
Then you can go to the GlassCount website and compare your results with others!

**THIS IS STILL A WORK-IN-PROGRESS (WIP)** -- It does not completely work yet, but stay tuned for updates!

Tutorial:  
1. Plug Glass into your computer via USB.  
2. Open a terminal console or command line and type: ```adb install GlassCount.apk```  
3. Say "ok glass, count another" to count another appearance.  
4. See other people's real-time results on the website (linked above).

To uninstall:  
Open a terminal console or command line and type: ```adb uninstall com.carrotcorp.glasscount```
